<header> <h2>The Story </h2> </header>

<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.</p>

<p>They said, <cite> “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.” </cite></p>
<p>The farmer said: <cite>“Maybe.” </cite></p>
<p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said:</p>
<p><cite>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</cite></p>
<p>The farmer again said, <cite>“Maybe.”</cite></p>
<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said:</p>

<p> <cite>“Oh dear, that’s too bad,” </cite> </p> and the farmer responded:

<p> <cite> “Maybe.” </cite> </p>
    <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said:</p>

<p> <cite> “Isn’t that great!”</cite> </p>

<p>Again, he said, <cite> “Maybe.”</cite> </p>

    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

<section>Conclusion</section>
<p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
